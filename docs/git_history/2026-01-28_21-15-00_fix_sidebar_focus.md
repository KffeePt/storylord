**Message:** fix(ui): set initial focus to sidebar on story load

## Description
Updated the application flow to set the initial focus to the Sidebar (Dashboard button) instead of the content area when a story is loaded. This provides a better navigation starting point as requested by the user.

Also includes extensive updates to `legacy/guac_cannon.md` by the user.
