I. FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS OF THE UNIVERSE (STORY RULES)

Constant 1 — No Violation of Physics
Nothing breaks known physics. The substance adds biological interfaces to existing forces.

Constant 2 — Energy Conservation
Every ability has:
*   Metabolic cost
*   Thermal signature
*   Neurological strain
*   No infinite power.

Constant 3 — Field Mediation
All abilities operate through fields:
*   Gravitational
*   Electromagnetic
*   Chemical signaling
*   Entropic gradients

Constant 4 — Instability Is Required
Perfect control causes:
*   Emotional flattening
*   Cognitive rigidity
*   Loss of creativity
*   Error = humanity.

II. ORIGIN & BIOLOGY

What the Comet Is
Not a rock. A fragment of an ancient show-tidal extrasolar biosphere.
*   Origin: Planet with strong tidal forces, radiation, temporal instability.
*   Organism: Fungal (optimal for information storage, adaptation, symbiosis).

Why Earth Is Compatible
Earth’s gravity is weak compared to origin. Allows field manipulation at biological scales without immediate collapse.

The Symbiotic Unit
*   Protein lattice
*   Virus-like genetic courier
*   Field-responsive microstructure
*   *Note: Firmware update, not hardware replacement.*

III. SUPERPOWER MECHANISMS

1. Gravitational Manipulation (Telekinesis)
Pulls/pushes via mass-effect amplifiers. No antigravity.
*   *Cost:* Micro-hemorrhages, migraines. Distance = exponential cost.

2. Optical Camouflage (Invisibility)
Photonic crystal lattices in skin bend light.
*   *Cost:* Severe heat buildup. "Heat ghosts" visible in IR.

3. Cognitive Interception (Prediction)
Reads biological signals (pheromones, micro-expressions) to predict intent.
*   *Cost:* Breaks down under stress. No true mind reading.

4. Regeneration
Guided stem-cell scaffolds. Preserves memory/neural architecture.
*   *Cost:* Massive nutrient requirement. Cancer risk.

5. Temporal Visions (Entropy Sampling)
Mind accesses low-entropy future probability states.
*   *Cost:* Unreliable. Observer bias corrupts data. Not prophecy.

IV. SECRET HISTORY (THE BACKBONE)

1968 Tlatelolco
*   **Real Event:** Political suppression.
*   **Secret Objective:** Acquisition of biological assets.
*   **The Original Scientists:** Student volunteers discovering the compound. Abducted. Most died.
*   **Legacy:** They proved it worked. They didn't know *why*.

The Synthetic Failure (The Chosen's Flaw)
The government/Chosen synthesized the compound but removed the "noise" (instability).
*   **Result:** Stable soldiers who are mentally brittle, emotionally flat, and lack empathy.
*   **The Chosen want:** Behavioral governance.
*   **The Flaw:** Without entropy, systems stagnate and rot.

V. THE WORLD BEFORE TERROR (BASELINE)

Mexico, near future.
*   Surveillance robots are normal.
*   Water inspections are routine.
*   Health alerts are frequent but contradictory.
*   Prices rise weekly.
*   Everyone feels tired, distracted, atomized.

Nothing is “wrong enough” to panic. People are too busy surviving to notice patterns.

---

VI. THE FORUM (GUAC) — LOW SIGNAL, HIGH NOISE

*   Barely active. Threads weeks apart.
*   Mix of: Political cynicism, Indigenous myths, Food jokes, Conspiracy-adjacent archaeology.
*   Most users are lurkers.
*   *The danger is that GUAC accidentally becomes correct.*

VII. CHARACTER SPEC — CANON v2

THE MODERN SCIENTISTS
1.  **The Modern Scientist (The Architect)**
    *   Physicist–archaeologist. Studied under The Head.
    *   Unified physics (entropy) and biology.
    *   Goal: Rediscover the original "unstable" source to fix the "sterile" synthetic rot.
    *   *Flaw:* Systems thinker. Comfortable with irreversible decisions.

2.  **The Colleague (The Ethicist)**
    *   Molecular biologist.
    *   Recruited by the Scientist. Falls in love through shared work.
    *   Discovers stabilization requirements.
    *   *Flaw:* Terrified of scale.

THE CHOSEN (ANTAGONISTS)
3.  **The Head (The Founder)**
    *   Mythic, unseen geneticist. Former teacher of the Scientist.
    *   Belief: "Order is compassion at scale."
    *   Created the sterile/synthetic version.

4.  **The Second-in-Command**
    *   Devout executor. Believes in the "Cure" for human chaotic nature.

5.  **The Generals**
    *   Mercenary commanders. Strictly tactical.

THE RESISTANCE & OBSERVERS
6.  **The Resistance Leader**
    *   Survivor of early trials (1980s-90s).
    *   Ideology: "Humanity must choose its own extinction or survival." trusts no one.

7.  **The Hacker** (GUAC)
    *   Infrastructure breaker. Traces the data leaks.
    *   *Quote:* "Stop speculating. Start preserving."

8.  **The Veteran** (GUAC)
    *   Brother died in trials. Physical reality check.

9.  **The Journalist** (GUAC)
    *   Accidental witness. Asks the wrong questions. Discredited.

10. **The “Godín”** (GUAC Normie)
    *   Office worker. Pattern synthesizer. The audience surrogate.

11. **The Medical Student** (GUAC)
    *   Scientific conscience. Cross-checks the myths against biology.

12. **The Embassy Secretary**
    *   Invisible observer. Notices the diplomatic irregularity.

VIII. HOW TERROR EMERGES (THE PHASES)

PHASE 1 — STRANGE COINCIDENCES
*   GUAC threads link cave drawings (molecular structures) to indigenous healing rituals.
*   The Medical Student notes: "That protein structure isn't natural."
*   The Modern Scientist lurks, watching them get close.

PHASE 2 — THE FIRST DATA LEAK
*   The Hacker finds intel on "Entropy Stabilization Trials."
*   Posts vague warning: "If you’re mapping myths to molecules, stop."
*   Nobody listens.

PHASE 3 — INSTITUTIONAL MISDIRECTION
*   Health Ministry Official expands "non-invasive" water testing.
*   He thinks it's for public health. It's actually a distribution test for the synthetic variant.

PHASE 4 — THE DIPLOMATIC GLITCH
*   Embassy Secretary sees emails routing Mexican trial data through foreign biotech fronts.
*   Realizes: Mexico is a test kitchen, not a partner.

PHASE 5 — THE COLLISION
*   The Veteran traces a supply drop. Meets The Hacker physically at an abandoned node.
*   They realize they are hunting the same thing: The ghost of the 1968 program.

PHASE 6 — THE PUBLIC TURN
*   The Journalist publishes.
*   She isn't killed. She is *discredited*.
*   Then she vanishes. GUAC archives her unfinished upload.

PHASE 7 — THE SILENT TAKEOVER
*   The Chosen (Generals) secure key water infrastructure.
*   No camps. No wars. Just "Health Protocols."
*   The Second-in-Command initiates the "Calibration" (mass dosing of synthetic stabilizer).

PHASE 8 — THE ROTTING
*   The side effects of the synthetic version start showing in the population.
*   Emotional flattening. Memory loss. Docility.
*   GUAC realizes: It's not a weapon. It's a lobotomy.

IX. THE SCIENTIST’S ENDGAME (THE TWIST)
*   The Modern Scientist isn't trying to stop the exposure.
*   He is trying to *swap* the strain.
*   He wants to introduce the *original, unstable, entropic* version into the water.
*   **Why?** Because the unstable version restores free will (via error/creativity) even if it kills some people with cancer/overload.
*   **The Choice:** Sterile safety (The Chosen) vs. Dangerous humanity (The Scientist).

---

X. HOW CHAOS FEELS
Not riots. Silence.
*   People apologizing while complying.
*   Art becoming sterile.
*   Friends becoming distant.
*   *The horror is that it's peaceful.*

---

XI. FINAL STORY CONSTANTS
1.  **No power without cost.**
2.  **Control destroys empathy.**
3.  **Perfect order kills art.**
4.  **Humanity survives through error.**
5.  **The future must remain unknowable.**
