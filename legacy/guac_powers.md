LORE SPEC — SUPERPOWERS, ORIGIN, HISTORY

I. FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS OF THE UNIVERSE (STORY RULES)

These are non-negotiable rules your story obeys.

Constant 1 — No Violation of Physics

Nothing breaks known physics.
The substance adds biological interfaces to existing forces.

Constant 2 — Energy Conservation

Every ability has:

Metabolic cost

Thermal signature

Neurological strain


No infinite power.

Constant 3 — Field Mediation

All abilities operate through fields:

Gravitational

Electromagnetic

Chemical signaling

Entropic gradients


Constant 4 — Instability Is Required

Perfect control causes:

Emotional flattening

Cognitive rigidity

Loss of creativity


Error = humanity.

II. ORIGIN OF THE COMET (COSMIC CONTEXT)

What the Comet Is

The “meteorite” is not a rock.

It is a fragment of an ancient extrasolar biosphere:

Originates from a planet with stronger tidal forces

Life evolved to survive:

Extreme gravity gradients

Radiation

Temporal instability



The organism is fungal because:

Fungi are optimal for:

Information storage

Environmental adaptation

Symbiosis



Why Earth Is Compatible

Earth’s gravity is weak compared to its origin world.

This allows:

Field manipulation at biological scales

Neural integration without immediate collapse


Why It Fell Multiple Times

The parent body:

Was shattered long ago

Seeds life intermittently across systems


Humanity is not unique—just early.


---

III. CORE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM

The Symbiotic Unit

Each spore contains:

A protein lattice

A virus-like genetic courier

A field-responsive microstructure


It does NOT replace human DNA. It overlays expression temporarily.

Think:

> Firmware update, not hardware replacement.




---

IV. SUPERPOWER MECHANISMS (PHYSICALLY PLAUSIBLE)

1. GRAVITATIONAL MANIPULATION (Telekinesis)

Mechanism

Proteins assemble near neurons

Act as biological mass-effect amplifiers

Slightly alter local spacetime curvature


No antigravity. No levitation.

Objects are moved by:

Redirecting gravitational vectors

Increasing effective mass gradients


Limits

Distance exponentially increases energy cost

Fine manipulation is harder than brute force

Requires synchronized neural firing


Side Effects

Micro-hemorrhages

Migraines

Disorientation



---

2. OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE (Invisibility)

Mechanism

Skin cells grow photonic crystal lattices

Lattices bend visible light around the body

Works like a biological metamaterial cloak


Limits

Infrared still detectable

Requires constant energy input

Heat buildup is severe


Failure Mode

Partial distortion

“Heat ghosts”

Skin necrosis if sustained



---

3. COGNITIVE INTERCEPTION (Mind Reading / Influence)

Mechanism Humans constantly emit:

Biochemical pheromones

Infrared micro-fluctuations

Subtle muscular pre-signals


The substance enhances:

Olfactory cortex

Visual temporal resolution

Pattern prediction


Users do not read thoughts. They predict intent with near-perfect accuracy.

Influence

Counter-pheromone emission

Emotional entrainment

Crowd biasing


Limits

Individual resistance possible

No long-range control

Breaks down under stress



---

4. REGENERATION

Mechanism

Self-replicating structural proteins

Act as guided stem-cell scaffolds

Preserve neural architecture


Memory remains intact.

Limits

Requires massive nutrients

Telomere strain

Cancer risk if regulation fails



---

5. TEMPORAL VISIONS (Entropy Sampling)

Mechanism The organism allows localized entropy minimization in neural microstructures.

This enables:

Statistical sampling of high-probability future states

Information leakage via retrocausal pathways


The brain receives:

Incomplete data

Symbolic impressions

Emotional forecasts


Not prophecy. Not certainty.

Why It’s Unreliable

Observer bias corrupts results

Changing behavior collapses prediction accuracy



---

V. WHY THE SYNTHETIC VERSION FAILS

The Chosen’s version lacks:

Proper entropy instability

Correct protein folding noise


Result:

Mirror neuron degradation

Empathy loss

Emotional flattening

Psychological rigidity


The supersoldiers are:

Physically unstable

Mentally brittle

Short-lived


They are tools that rot.


---

VI. HISTORICAL INTEGRATION — 1968 TLATELOLCO (LORE CANON)

What Really Happened

The 1968 massacre was:

Not only political suppression

Also biological asset acquisition


The government had:

Early intelligence on meteorite-derived compounds

Crude extraction methods

No understanding of stability


Student scientists:

Volunteers

Idealists

Not leaders of the movement


They were studying:

Neurochemistry

Genetics

Archaeological anomalies


Their work was too valuable.

The Massacre’s Hidden Purpose

The public narrative:

Political unrest

Military overreaction


The hidden objective:

Create chaos

Mask targeted abductions

Secure original researchers


The massacre was cover noise.


---

VII. THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS (1968–2008)

The Compound Facilities

Isolated

Military-controlled

Classified as medical research


Subjects:

Prisoners

Abducted volunteers

Political dissidents


Outcomes:

Most withered

Many died from neural collapse

Others rebelled and were executed


No spectacle. No records.


---

VIII. THE RESISTANCE LEADER

She was:

A long-term subject

Exposed to early synthetic iterations

One of the few biologically compatible individuals


She escaped decades later.

Her ideology:

> Humanity must choose its own extinction or survival.



She trusts no cure.


---

IX. HOW THE CHOSEN INHERITED CONTROL

Original scientists aged or died

Knowledge fragmented

Corporations absorbed the work

Intelligence agencies centralized it


The Head:

Academic origin

Geneticist

Architect of synthesis

Believed order is mercy


He never saw himself as evil.


---

X. WHY THIS ALL SUPPORTS THE ENDING

The scientist’s fix:

Reintroduces entropy

Preserves regeneration

Eliminates domination vectors


By contaminating water:

No hierarchy

No elite access

No weaponization


The Chosen lose purpose.


---

XI. FINAL STORY CONSTANTS (WRITE THESE ON THE WALL)

1. No power without cost


2. Control destroys empathy


3. Perfect order kills art


4. Humanity survives through error


5. The future must remain unknowable
