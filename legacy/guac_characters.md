CHARACTER SPEC — CANON v2

I. THE TWO SCIENTIST GENERATIONS (CRITICAL FIX)

GENERATION 1 — THE ORIGINAL SCIENTISTS (1968)

(Historical, mostly dead, fragmented legacy)

Role: The Abducted Student Scientists

Young university students

Part of the 1968 movement, but not leaders

Volunteers in neurochemistry, early genetics, archaeology

Idealistic, politically awake, scientifically naïve


Contribution

First isolation of meteorite-derived fungal compounds

Crude extraction

No stabilization

No understanding of entropy effects


Fate

Abducted during Tlatelolco

Forced into state-run experiments

Knowledge fragmented across agencies

Most die

A few survive long enough to pass incomplete data forward


Legacy

They proved it worked

They didn’t know why



---

II. MODERN SCIENTISTS (2030–2035)

These are the true protagonists of the science, not the origin.


---

1. THE MODERN SCIENTIST (PRIMARY ARCHITECT)

Role

Physicist–archaeologist–systems thinker

The most brilliant mind in the story

Not a traditional academic by the end


Background

Studied under the Head decades earlier

Rejected rigid institutional science

Drifted into archaeology to chase unanswered anomalies

Active lurker on GUAC long before discovery


Core Contribution

Rediscovered the meteorite fragment

Unified:

Physics (fields, entropy)

Biology (symbiosis)

Archaeology (ritualized exposure)


Identified gravitational field mediation

Mapped temporal entropy sampling

Designed the final global fix


Flaw

Thinks in systems, not individuals

Comfortable making irreversible decisions

Believes humanity cannot survive without intervention


Arc

From seeker → architect → world-altering criminal

Will never know if he was right



---

2. THE COLLEAGUE (STABILIZATION SPECIALIST)

Role

Molecular biologist / geneticist

Ethicist by temperament

Emotional counterweight to the Scientist


Background

Top-tier academic

Initially skeptical

Recruited after proof, not theory

Falls in love through shared work, not romance


Core Contribution

Stabilization and purification

Discovers:

Protein folding instability

Telomere degradation in synthetic versions


Develops sustained regeneration

Only possible with pure compound


Identifies why synthetic regeneration:

Scars

Requires escalating dosage

Eventually fails entirely



Flaw

Terrified of scale

Believes consent matters even during collapse


Arc

Scientist → Doubter → Almost-Obstacle → Enabler

Helps only after strong evidence, not faith



---

III. THE CHOSEN (ANTAGONISTIC SYSTEM)

3. THE HEAD (FOUNDER OF THE CHOSEN)

Role

Architect of controlled evolution

Mythic presence

Never fully seen


Background

Brilliant geneticist

Former professor to the Modern Scientist

Studied fragments of 1968 research

Understood the what, not the why


Belief

> Order is compassion at scale.



Contribution

Created the synthetic compound

Accepted degradation as “acceptable loss”

Built The Chosen as a governing organism


Flaw

Confuses optimization with morality

Cannot tolerate uncertainty



---

4. THE SECOND-IN-COMMAND

Role

Devotee, executor, strategist

Idolizes the Head


Contribution

Oversees enforcement

Manages Generals

Handles containment and extraction


Flaw

Religious faith in order

No internal doubt



---

5. THE GENERALS

Role

Commanders of elite mercenary forces

Surgical, disciplined, brutal


Function

Secure facilities

Eliminate instability

Extract or erase assets


Note

They do not understand the science

They follow doctrine



---

IV. THE RESISTANCE

6. THE RESISTANCE LEADER

Role

Survivor

Ideologue

Reluctant ally


Background

Prisoner in early synthetic trials

One of the few biologically compatible

Escaped decades later


Belief

> No one should decide humanity’s future.



Contribution

Exposes cruelty of synthetic programs

Distrusts cures

Will work with the Scientist only tactically



---

V. GUAC CORE CHARACTERS

7. THE HACKER

Role

Infrastructure breaker

Pattern recognizer


Background

Self-taught

Occasionally posted on GUAC

Discovers truth independently


Arc

Lone operator → reluctant collaborator



---

8. THE VETERAN

Role

Physical reality check

Tactical survivor


Background

Brother died in failed trials

Has hunted the system for years


Arc

Revenge-driven → purpose-conflicted



---

9. THE JOURNALIST

Role

Witness

Archivist of truth


Background

Small outlet

No protection

Asks the wrong questions


Arc

Learns too much

Does not survive

Her work does



---

10. THE “GODÍN” (Normie)

Role

Audience surrogate

Pattern synthesizer


Background

Overqualified office worker

Took the safe path

Brilliant but unused


Arc

Passive observer → active participant

“Breaking bad” morally, not criminally



---

11. THE MEDICAL STUDENT

Role

Scientific conscience of GUAC


Background

Top of her class

Future neurosurgeon/geneticist


Arc

From skeptic → believer → moral challenger



---

VI. GOVERNMENT FIGURES

12. HEALTH MINISTRY OFFICIAL

Role

Institutional pawn


Background

Honest

Procedural

Believes in data


Arc

Signs things he doesn’t fully understand

Realizes too late



---

13. EMBASSY SECRETARY

Role

Accidental whistleblower


Background

Invisible by design

Observant


Arc

Steals truth

Cannot go back



---

VII. FINAL STRUCTURAL BALANCE

The Original Scientists → Proof

The Head → Control

The Modern Scientist → Synthesis

The Colleague → Stability

The World → Consequence


This now fully supports the ending, the timeline, and the moral weight.
